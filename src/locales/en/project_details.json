    "long_description": "The blog is a personal blog project developed from scratch with the goal of studying and applying modern web development technologies. The system was built as a fullstack experimentation environment, combining advanced frontend, backend, and database integration practices.\n\nOn the frontend, the project uses React, Next.js, and TailwindCSS to create modern, responsive, and high-performance interfaces. On the backend, it was implemented with TypeScript and Node.js, ensuring static typing and better code organization. The chosen database was SQLite, allowing for simple and efficient integration.\n\nThe main objectives include: building fullstack applications with Next.js, TypeScript, and Node.js; creating responsive interfaces using React and TailwindCSS; integrating the SQLite database; implementing authentication and authorization; developing a complete CRUD for post management; and organizing a scalable architecture.\n\nAmong the functionalities already implemented are: individual page for each post, user login, administration panel for managing posts, public listing with date and author, and a system for creating, editing, and deleting posts (CRUD)."
